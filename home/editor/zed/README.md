## Day 0: Navigation

First command to learn:

cmd-shift-p     find any command

Immediately after that: open the default key bindings and the default vim keybindings as an exercise. Use `/` to search in a buffer, e.g., to find the keybinding for the function you are looking for.

Main concepts:

* Buffers: same as in nvim, editing context holding text
* Tabs: container for buffers, multiple tabs managed in the same pane
* Panes: Section in a window containing tabs
* Windows: outer container

Navigate between different tabs in the same window:

cmd-alt-left / cmd-alt-right

Navigate between panes:

ctrl-w h (or: jkl)
ctrl-w w    other pane

First things first: navigation

cmd-p   find file in workspace
g /     search contents in workspace (will open multi buffer)
